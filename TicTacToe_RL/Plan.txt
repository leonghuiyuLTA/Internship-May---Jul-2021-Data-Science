5 Things required for an RL process:
State - Board and its components
Action - Place X/O on board
Reward - Win, Lose, Tie
Environment - The Tic Tac Toe Environment
Agent - players


Basic TTT:
3x3 board, 8 win conditions
players take turns to place X/O
win/lose/draw need to be checked, then game is over(Flag?)


Environment:
Prints current state(UI)
X|O|X
-----
O|X|O
-----
X|O|X

Choose Row:
Choose Col:

State:
Current state of the board, detect win/lose/end
Resets when required.
Maintains a list of legal moves - to iterate through and choose best

Reward(values can be changed later):
Win = 1
Lose = 0
Tie = 0.5

Agent:
P1, P2, each maintains the set of states it goes through, used to reverse propagate the reward values at the end.
